# design-sync notes — Rhapsody Design System

This project is **hand-authored**, outside the /design-sync converter's envelope
(there is no `package.json`, `dist/`, or Storybook). The HTML preview cards are
already in the format the Claude Design app consumes.

## How syncing works here
- Each `components/*.html` starts with a `<!-- @dsCard group="..." name="..."
  subtitle="..." width height -->` marker.
- The app builds its component index from `_ds_manifest.json` (`cards[]`).
  `register_assets` is legacy and does NOT update that file — do not rely on it.
- To sync: push the changed `components/*.html` + `tokens.css`, then regenerate
  `_ds_manifest.json` `cards[]` from the `@dsCard` markers and push it too.
  Keep the group/subtitle in the manifest identical to the file markers so an
  app-side self-check recompile produces the same grouping.
- Group order in the pane follows the numeric prefix: 1 Foundations, 2 Brand,
  3 Components, 4 Graphic devices, 5 Iconography, 6 Imagery, 7 Patterns,
  8 Reference.

## Gotcha fixed 2026-08-02
Remote HTML `@dsCard` headers and `_ds_manifest.json` had drifted from local
(Patterns numbered "6" on remote vs "7" locally; new dot cards + product-launch
missing from the manifest). Full parity re-push of all 28 cards + tokens.css +
regenerated manifest fixed it. When editing groups, always re-push BOTH the
HTML files and the manifest together.
